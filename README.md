# FileCompressor
Just an application to compress a file using huffman-Compression
I cannot guarantee that it is lossless as of now, but I do plan on working on it again. It is incredibly slow and already know how to improve it to be at about twice the speed.

ps.:
please excuse the strong language in some of these commits. This was a very hard project for me to realise as a beginner. 
Obviously I would keep professional Commits informative and structured.
